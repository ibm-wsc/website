Use IBM zBNA to evaluate the impact of new technology exploitation such as zEDC, DFSMS Encryption, zHyperLink, and DFSORT IBM Z Sort. IBM zBNA provides powerful, graphic demonstration of the z/OS batch window, which can be automatically captured in a report file using the Named Favorites feature. Tooling IBM z Processor Capacity Reference Link IBM zPCR is a PC-based productivity tool for Windows and macOS. It is designed to provide capacity planning insight for IBM Z and LinuxONE processors running LPAR configurations with various workload environments under z/OS, z/VM, z/VSE, KVM, Linux, SSC, and CFCC. Capacity results are based on IBM's LSPR data supporting all IBM Z and LinuxONE processors including the new IBM z16 A02/AGZ and LinuxONE Rockhopper 4 processor families. Tooling IBM Z Software Migration Capacity Planning Aid Link IBM Z Software Migration Capacity Planning Aid (IBM zSoftCap) is PC-based tool that evaluates the effect on IBM Z processor capacity when migrating to newer levels of software, including z/OS, z/VSE, CICS, and IMS. IBM zSoftCap assumes that the hardware configuration remains constant while the software version or release changes.
